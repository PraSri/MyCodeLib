The problem was like: given a list of transaction <from, to, amount>,
I have to settle them and return who will pay whom, how much.
(note: it did not ask me to find the most optimal way to settle like in Splitwise simplify balance feature).

I gave a solution, and coded it.
I did it in Java to use Oops etc(as i use Java in my day to day job)
but I practice DSA with c++.
And it lead to multiple compilation errors, as I haven't used a lot of datastructures in Java.
My suggestion will be to stick to one language for coding.
I told the intervviewer regading the same and they were ok and said they are fine with the solution.

In last 5min they asked me a follow up,
what is the most optimal way to settle the balance. I gave them a greedy solution and we ended the interview.
