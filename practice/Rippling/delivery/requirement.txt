Part 1

Write code in JAVA using OOPS and proper names for this requirement.Given a list of some drivers and the deliveries they are making,
need to write a code to compute the total cost of all deliveries.
It needed to have 3 methods:
add driver(driverId)
add deliveries(startTime, endTime)
getTotalCost()

getTotalCost was needed in optimised time, which can be provided by computing cost at the time of adding the delivery.

Part 2

Add two more functionalities
payUpToTime(upToTime) -> settle the delivery cost up to this time
getCostToBePaid() -> get the remaining delivery costs left after settling the payment

Part 3
Implement a method to provide simultaneous deliveries across drivers.


Given a list of delivery drivers, the per hour payment of each driver
and a list of deliveries they do, your job is to find the total to be paid to all the driver combined.
Write a production quality code in JAVA OOPS using some design pattern.
Create respective functions:
Add driver and per hour rate.
Add delivery (This was epoch seconds)
Get total to amount to be paid to all drivers.
Given a time when we clear payments, output the total that has to be paid.
Also, there should be another function that returns the total unpaid.
