Problem Statement: Design a Song Play Analytics System
AND
Question about designing music library where we had to print the most played songs(by unique users).
This was then extended to also add a function to return 3 unique most recently played songs.

Write JAVA code using OOPS style with popular design patterns
Design a system to track song plays and generate analytics based on
the number of unique listeners per song.
Implement the SongAnalytics class with the following methods:

SongAnalytics() - Initializes the system.

int add_song(string name) - Adds a song to the system, assigns it a unique auto-incrementing ID starting from 1,
and returns the assigned ID.

void play_song(int song_id, int user_id) - Records a play event for a song by a user.
If song_id does not exist, output: Error: Song ID <song_id> does not exist. (replace <song_id> with the invalid ID).
Each user is counted once per song, even if they play it multiple times.

void print_analytics() - Prints a summary of all songs sorted by the number of unique listeners in descending order.
If two songs have the same number of unique listeners, sort them lexicographically by name in ascending order.

Each line in the output should follow the format: <song_name> (<count> unique listeners).
Example:
Input:
add_song("Song A") ? returns 1
add_song("Song B") ? returns 2
add_song("Song C") ? returns 3
play_song(1, 1)
play_song(1, 2)
play_song(2, 1)
play_song(3, 3)
play_song(3, 3)
print_analytics()

Output:
Song A (2 unique listeners)
Song B (1 unique listeners)
Song C (1 unique listeners)

Add extra requirement
1. Print most played song by unique users
2. Print 3 unique most recently played songs
