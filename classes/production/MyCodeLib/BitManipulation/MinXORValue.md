# Given an integer array A of N integers, find the pair of integers in the array which have minimum XOR value. Report the minimum XOR value.

The first step is to sort the array. The answer will be the minimal value of X[i] XOR X[i+1] for every i.

## Proof:
Let’s suppose that the answer is not X[i] XOR X[i+1], but A XOR B and there exists C in the array such as A <= C <= B.

Next is the proof that either A XOR C or C XOR B are smaller than A XOR B.

Let A[i] = 0/1 be the i-th bit in the binary representation of A
Let B[i] = 0/1 be the i-th bit in the binary representation of B
Let C[i] = 0/1 be the i-th bit in the binary representation of C

This is with the assumption that all of A, B and C are padded with 0 on the left until they all have the same length

## Example:
A=169, B=187, C=185
A=101010012
B=101110112
C=101110012

Let i be the leftmost (biggest) index such that A[i] differs from B[i]. There are 2 cases now:
1) C[i] = A[i] = 0,
then (A XOR C)[i] = 0 and (A XOR B)[i] = 1
This implies (A XOR C) < (A XOR B)
2) C[i] = B[i] = 1,
then (B XOR C)[i] = 0 and (A XOR B)[i] = 1
This implies (B XOR C) < (A XOR B)

### Time complexity: O(N * logN) to sort the array and O(N) to find the smallest XOR
### Space complexity: O(N)
